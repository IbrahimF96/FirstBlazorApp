This is a small blazor sever app experiment, the goal was to have some first hand experience with Blazor whilst creating a mini game web app. The web app is centred around the common memory match card game. 
The user loads the site and enters their name in the given field, then the site loads the cards to play with a maximum of 10 attempts to clear all the cards.
On the final page, we show some of the highest scores made by users.
